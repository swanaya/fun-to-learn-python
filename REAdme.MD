# 1. Setting Up a Virtual Environment:
To keep your dependencies isolated and the environment clean, you can create a virtual environment in Python. Here‚Äôs how:

Steps to Create a Virtual Environment:
Install virtualenv (if not installed):

bash
Copy code
pip install virtualenv
Create a new virtual environment: Navigate to your project directory and run:

bash
Copy code
virtualenv venv
This will create a new directory called venv where the environment and installed packages will reside.

Activate the virtual environment:

On Windows:
bash
Copy code
venv\Scripts\activate
On macOS/Linux:
bash
Copy code
source venv/bin/activate
Install the required libraries: After activating the virtual environment, you can install the required packages:

bash
Copy code
pip install scikit-learn torch
If you have a requirements.txt file, you can install everything at once:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Now you have a virtual environment set up, isolated from the global Python installation.
